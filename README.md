## Dom Manipulation
`DOM manipulation` is the main feature of this project. There is an `index.html` file which contains a few lines to start with. The rest is rendered on the screen using JavaScript and requesting info from the  Rick and Morty API. 

> Every time you hit the "See more swchiwty characters" the whole section is "destroyed" and a new one is created and rendered.

You can see how the site looks like previous to rendering info from the API:

## Asynchronous functions
⏱ Since we are requesting info from an API, we use asynchronous functions (async-await, ECMAScript 6). The whole web-app is rendered in this section. 

## API Requests
When entering the site, JavaScript will request info from the Rick and Morty API. This info includes, but it is not limited to:
- 🤓 Character name
- 🌎 Character origin
- 🐸 Character species.

Since the API is divided into different sections (or pages), we generate a random number to acces a different page from the API everytime you reload the site. This also allows different characters to be displayed every time you hit the "See more schwifty characters" button.

## Lazy Loading
I know, I know. This is not a complex web app. But this site is meant to show my skills. Lazy loading is usually implemented when we need to save mobile data. I used an intersection observer in order to know when the `img tag` enters the viewport. When this happens, the picture is loaded.

## Mobile first design
The site is responsive. By the time I'm writing this, I'm not a designer myself, but I tried to copy the original designs from the Rick and Morty API. So, yes. This project is responsive. This was achieved by using the Tailwind framework for CSS. 

You might be wondering why I say this is mobile first design when previous images are desktop captures. And that's a good point. The answer is: I had already edited the previous images and didn't want to start all over again.
